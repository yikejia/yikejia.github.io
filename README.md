# Project Purpose: Factor Analysis
• Identify multiple factors and perform thorough analysis on information coefficient (1D, 5D, 10D), their cumulative IC and
ICIR for a specified market universe
• The factors have theoretical base, which is identified through reading top academic journals (JF, JFE, RFS, JFQA) or industry journal (JPM, FRL etc.). 
• Quantile return analysis, correlation among factors, Barra decomposition (optional) etc
• We use MAD remove outliers (MAD is a measure of how much the values in a data set vary from the meanAD) and Z score normalization to deal with data
We use Russell 2000 Index as our data
