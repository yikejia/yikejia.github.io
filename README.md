# Project Purpose: Factor Analysis
• Utilized data from the Russell 2000 Index, applying Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for outlier removal and Z-score normalization to ensure data consistency and accuracy.

• Developed factors based on strong theoretical foundations, drawing insights from top academic journals (JF, JFE, RFS, JFQA) and industry sources (JPM, FRL).

• Performed comprehensive factor analysis, focusing on information coefficient (IC) over 1D, 5D, and 10D periods, and evaluated cumulative IC and ICIR to assess factor efficacy.

• Conducted quantile return analysis and correlation studies among factors, with optional Barra decomposition for multi-dimensional insights.
